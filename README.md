## Collaborative Lunar Lander
---
#### Code developed and modified during the semester project for the AI Applications class of the [MSc in Artificial Intelligence](http://msc-ai.iit.demokritos.gr/) by NCSR Demokritos and University of Piraeus.

The project investigates the collaboration of human users with artificial agents towards achieving high rewards while interacting with the [LunarLander-v2 Gym](https://gym.openai.com/envs/LunarLander-v2/) environment.

Code from [Maze 3D Collaborative Learning on shared task](https://github.com/ligerfotis/maze3d_collaborative) repository was used as baseline, which was adjusted to the Lunar Lander environment functions and controls.
